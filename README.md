## 🛠 How It Works

The scraper:

**1.** Starts from page 1 of the KL rental listing page  
**2.** Loops through each listing block  
**3.** Extracts relevant info using `BeautifulSoup`  
**4.** Cleans up fields (removes special characters, parentheses, etc.)  
**5.** Continues until no more listings are found  
**6.** Stores all data into a `pandas.DataFrame` and exports to `CSV`
